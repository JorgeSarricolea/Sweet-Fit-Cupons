# Getting started

Sweet Fit restaurant needed a tailored administrative platform to efficiently manage and distribute coupons, targeting customer acquisition and enhancing their marketing strategies. To fulfill this requirement, a custom system was developed from scratch. 

The back-end was built using a REST API with JavaScript and NodeJS, employing Prisma as the ORM and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for structure and maintainability. 

For the front-end, the development team implemented Astro and TailwindCSS, resulting in a responsive and user-friendly interface. This platform simplifies coupon management and enables Sweet Fit to execute and monitor promotional campaigns effectively.

## Development and production environment.

The repository has three branches; **prod**, **dev** and **hot-fixes**;

> [!TIP]
> **Branches:** These are parallel versions of the code base that allow working on different functionalities or bug fixes independently. In this case, three main branches are mentioned:

**🚀 prod (short for "production"):** This branch typically contains the stable version of the code that is ready to be deployed to a production environment, that is, the environment where end users interact with the live application.

**🛠️ dev (short for "development"):** This branch is often used to integrate new features and major code changes. It is a development environment where changes are tested and integrated before being promoted to the production branch.

**🔥 hot-fixes (short for "quick fixes"):** This branch is used to fix critical or urgent bugs in the production version without having to wait for the next planned release. Hot-fixes are deployed quickly and applied directly to the production branch to fix urgent issues.

> [!WARNING]
> **Note:** Make sure you don't make changes to the prod branch, much less make unauthorized merges to avoid problems.
